# PyAEDT and PyTorch Learning Repository

Welcome to my learning repository! As a newcomer to PyAEDT and PyTorch, I've created a collection of Python scripts to explore electromagnetic simulations and neural network optimizations. These scripts represent my initial attempts and experimentation in these fields.

## Overview

This repository contains various scripts that focus on:

- Electromagnetic component analysis
- Neural network modeling and optimization
- Data handling for simulations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the scripts, you'll need:

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- PyAEDT
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for any visualizations)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
